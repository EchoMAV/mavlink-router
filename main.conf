# EchoPilot AI mavlink-router configuration file.
# Note, this file may be auto-generated depending on your configuration. 

[General]
# this section only has one instance and therefore no name

# Print traffic statistics to stdout
# Default: <false>
#ReportStats = false

# Logging verbosity (stderr)
# Valid values: <error>, <warning>, <info> or <debug>
# Default: <info>
DebugLogLevel = info

# Enable de-duplication of incoming messages. If a message is received another
# time in the configured time period (in milliseconds), it will be dropped. The
# second message will reset the timer.
# It should be a bit higher, than the latency of the slowest link. More than
# 1000 ms might drop packets unintentionally though.
# Default: 0 (de-duplication disabled)
#DeDuplicationPeriod = 0

## TCP Server Endpoints

# Listen for TCP connections on this port. Set to 0 to disable.
# Default: 5760
TcpServerPort = 5760

## UART Endpoint Configurations
## Duplicate sections (with a different name) to create multiple endpoints
##

## EchoPilot UART input. Please ensure the autopilot is configured to output MAVLink2 on SERIAL2 at 500,000 kbps. On most systems this will be /dev/ttyTHS0, but could be /dev/ttyTHS1
## Do not change the name of the endpoint as it may interfere with the web configuration UI
[UartEndpoint alpha]
Device = /dev/ttyTHS0
Baud = 500000

##
## UDP Endpoint Configuration Alpha
##

## send to <IP ADDRESS>:14550. This should be the IP addres of your host computer running ground control software (QGCS or Mission Planner)
## Do not change the name of the endpoint as it may interfere with the web configuration UI
[UdpEndpoint alpha]
Mode = Normal
Address = 10.223.1.10
Port = 14550

##
## TCP Client Endpoint Configuration Alpha
##
## Do not change the name of the endpoint as it may interfere with the web configuration UI
#[TcpEndpoint alpha]
#Address = 10.223.1.10
